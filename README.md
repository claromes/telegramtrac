A browser interface to Telegramâ€™s API. Provides modules for connecting, signing in and communicating via Telethon. Generates files containing messages and metadata. It also includes additional modules for data analysis. telegramtrac is a fork of the Python package Telegram Tracker.

The application is available on Streamlit Community Cloud with limited server resources.

> [!NOTE]
> The application can be resource-intensive, and the free Streamlit Cloud Community option is not sufficient. Therefore, setting up the development environment and running locally may be more effective for Telegram channels with a lot of activity.
