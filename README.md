## Tool Description
telegramtrac is a web-based tool designed for tracking public channels on Telegram. It's a fork of the package [`telegram-tracker`](https://github.com/estebanpdl/telegram-tracker) developed by Esteban Ponce de Le√≥n, DFRLab researcher.

I became familiar with the package during the DFRLab's Digital Sherlocks Program and believe that an accessible version would benefit researchers of different skill levels.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+

## Installation

$ `git clone git@github.com:claromes/telegramtrac.git`

$ `cd telegramtrac`

$ `pip install -r requirements.txt`

$ `streamlit run streamlit/telegramtrac.py`

Streamlit will be served at http://localhost:8501

## Usage

2. Fill the inputs `api_id`, `api_hash` and your `phone` number (*following this format: +5500912348765*) and click on `send credentials` button

- A 5-digit code will be send to your Telegram app

3. Fill the input `code` and `password` (For Two-Step Verification enabled users) and click on `sign in` button

- A message will be send to your Telegram app about the authentication

4. Fill the input `channel name` (*copy name from channel link: t.me/CHANNEL_NAME*) and click on `trac` button

- It may take a few minutes...

5. Switch tabs to preview or download the data

6. To track another channel, switch to last tab (`trac`) and click `new trac`.

7. Fill the input `channel name` (*copy name from channel link: t.me/CHANNEL_NAME*) and click on `trac` button

- At each tracking the dataset are grouped in the same file to allow network analysis

## Additional Information

### Limitations

- Only one channel per track
- Each sign-in generates a new instance

### Design decisions

Mostly limited to Streamlit options. The form and tabs were chosen due to common use in web apps.
