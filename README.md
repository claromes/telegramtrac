A browser interface to Telegramâ€™s API. Provides modules for connecting, signing in and communicating via Telethon. Generates files containing messages and metadata. It also includes additional modules for data analysis. telegramtrac is a [Telegram Tracker](https://github.com/estebanpdl/telegram-tracker) fork.

## Cloud App

> [!NOTE]
> The application can be resource-intensive, and the free Streamlit Cloud Community option is not sufficient. Therefore, setting up the development environment and running locally may be more effective for Telegram channels with a lot of activity.
